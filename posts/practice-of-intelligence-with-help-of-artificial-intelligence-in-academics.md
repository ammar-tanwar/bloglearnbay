## Artificial Intelligence:- Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just contained in science fiction films. Instead, it is increasingly becoming a significant part of our everyday lives. We already use tools like <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/siri/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Siri</a> and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's Alexa</a> and are just beginning to see the possibilities of AI in education. And we should expect to see more. According to Global Market Insights Inc., the Artificial Intelligence education market might be worth $20 billion by 2027.

## With the expected growth of AI in education here is a glimpse into some of the roles it will play in Academics.   

### 1. Automate Grading:-

Imagine the advancement in teaching once the teachers have assistance in their grading. With AI, the role of a grader can be passed along. Current AI technology is already able to automate the grading of multiple-choice materials. Still, as AI develops and becomes more intelligent, it is expected that the technology will one day be able to grade more than standardized assessments.

### 2. Support Teachers:- 

In addition to helping with grading, AI will also support teachers in other ways. For example, some of the routine tasks can be managed by AI. As well as communication with students. For example, one college professor successfully used an AI chatbot to communicate with students as a teaching assistant all semester without students knowing they were not talking to a human.

### 3. Support Students:-

Pearson has already suggested that students will have an AI lifelong learning companion in the future. Essentially, this next generation of students will grow up with an AI companion who knows their personal and school history. Therefore, it will know each student's strengths and weaknesses.

### 4. Meet a Variety of Student Needs:-  

In addition to acting as a personalized learning companion, AI can also help students with special needs by adapting materials to lead them to success. For instance, studies are already showing positive results for AI teaching ASD students social skills.

### 5. Allow Teachers to Act as Learning Motivators:-   
 
As AI takes on more of a teaching role by providing students with basic information, it will change the role of teachers in the classroom. Teachers will move into the role of classroom facilitator or learning motivator.

### 6. Provide Personalized Help:-   
 
AI will also provide personalized tutoring for students outside of the classroom. For example, when students need to reinforce skills or master ideas before an assessment, AI can provide students with the additional tools they need for success.

### 7. Identify Weaknesses in the Classroom:-   

AI will also work in identifying classroom weaknesses. For instance, AI will identify when groups of students miss specific questions letting the teacher know when material needs to be retaught. In this way, AI will also hold teachers accountable and employ best teaching practices.

While artificial Intelligence will not replace teachers altogether, it may reshape how teachers teach and students learn.

## AI in Education   

There are other advantages to Artificial Intelligence integration in the Education sector.

- AI can help global teaching become a successful venture for teachers to teach students anywhere in the world with the same level of proficiency as a classroom live session. Not only that, but students speaking other languages or having visual/hearing impairments will also benefit from these classes.
- Students with illness may miss a session. This can be negated by the inclusion of AI in schools. Those who can't attend can get easy access to the sessions and learn.
- Some students require a different kind of teaching method than others. This can be made accessible through AI. Those who want to learn the subjects that are not available in their curriculum can have access to their preferred course through AI.

AI is expected to improve, and with continued progress in the field of data science and AI, it is believed that AI will eventually assist educators in making more progress in tackling a variety of physical, intellectual, academic, sociological, and emotional factors affecting a student's development. Irrespective of their socio-economic status, color, gender, sexuality, ethnic heritage, or mental and physical disability, the pupils will have an equal chance in education.

### Individualized Learning:-  

As AI becomes an integral part of classroom teaching, an individualized learning experience can be offered to each student. AI and teachers can help tailor lessons to different students' abilities and skill levels. This will help them provide an identical learning experience to each student, as teachers often focus their attention on the middle.

AI will help educators understand their students individually and more efficiently. They can then target them accordingly to enhance their learning prowess.

## What now?    


There is convincing evidence, which is discussed in this paper showing AI solutions bring up a new vista of potential for higher education learning and teaching. Nevertheless, it is critical to acknowledge the existing limitations of science and acknowledge that AI is just not (currently) capable of replacing teachers but instead offers the potential to enhance them.

We are increasingly witnessing computational algorithms affecting the essential areas of daily life, including people's credit ratings to employment. Higher education is at the epicenter of this fundamental transformation, providing great potential and challenges.

When used appropriately, the true promise of high ed technology is to increase human capacities and opportunities for educating, studying, and researching.

## Conclusion:- 

Personalization is the main point of interest in many industries. Thanks to AI, it is possible to enhance the education sector beyond the previous limitations. AI enables educators to raise their game, offering them all the required knowledge. It also helps educators generate information tailored to their student's needs, assuring individualized learning. It automates chores, giving teachers additional time to educate and significantly influence their pupils.
