<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Know the Importance of Data Science in the Medical Industry </span>


Got your master's degree in genetic counseling, occupational therapy, health administration, or any other healthcare domain? Are you anxious to join a renowned organization with a six-figure salary package? But wait. It's not that easy these days. More than 70% of lucrative healthcare degree holders still need to secure their position. 

*What's the reason? They all are well qualified and experienced enough.* 

Well, this industry has had a new 'must-have' skill requirement for the last few years. It's **Data Science and AI**. 

Yes, data science and AI have changed the direction of the job market. There are many vacancies and candidates roaming around to fill those positions. Still, there needs to be more hiring. Some people work almost 24X7 with a package of 3 LPA-4 LPA, even after getting a master's degree. 

However, there is a contrasting side as well. A few enjoy 10 to 12 LPA, with an average of 3 to 4 years of experience in the same domain.

This blog will help you find the root path to secure your data science jobs in the healthcare sector. 

First, let me answer the questions coming to the mind of most readers right now.

## Do data science jobs in the healthcare sector come with attractive packages?

Nowadays, while we think about the healthcare system, we visualize highly tech-upgraded and AI-powered patient care services, including SMART clinical apparatus and advanced medical research. But for the last few years, the healthcare industry has been in the topmost position on cyber criminals' hit list. 

According to the Accenture Survey in 2017, about 26% of US patients became victims of such birches in the first quarter. 

During the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, lots of COVID-positive patients' sensitive personal data, like residential addresses, contact numbers, Aadhar numbers, etc., got leaked from several governments and NABL healthcare portals. Such incidents caused the suspension of many frontlines and associated employees. 

*Wrong handling of data and the lack of data management expertise was the key reason behind it.*

Employees from a non-data science background in healthcare are at risk of job loss. This is because so many pharmaceutical companies are now tying up for better regional sales worldwide. 

Recently, US-based pharma company Eli Lilly fired 120 Indian office employees because of the transfer of anti-diabetic medicine selling rights to Cipla (Source: The Economic Times). 

This is very common in business, but candidates with core data science skills and analytical knowledge are in quite a safer position. The Pharma industry needs them as they suffer from a massive lack of such talent. 

Healthcare data science jobs are a must because when you look at it, healthcare is one domain where data science has been used predominantly and for a very long time. The clinical industry can only run by applying some data science concepts. So there is no doubt that you will have a great scope in the healthcare industry as a data scientist. 

But does it provide just as excellent a salary as working in a product-based MNC? Let's look at what your data science salary will depend upon to find the answer.

### What Drives a Data Scientist's salary?     

We all know and hear that specialists in this field make a lot of money, but we must be aware that it varies from domain to domain. A <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/is-your-data-scientist-salary-competitive-cross-check-with-the-latest-trends" target="_blank">data scientist’s salary</a> depends on these factors.

- Need for data science in the industry. 
- The type of role that you will be playing.

## Why is data science important in healthcare?     

According to one study (source: daily mail UK), the amount of data produced by all human bodies is two terabytes per day. This data includes brain activity, stress levels, heart rate, sugar content, and more. 

- There are now more advanced technologies for processing such large amounts of data, one of which is data science. It helps monitor the patient's health based on the recorded data. 

- With the help of data science in medicine, it has become possible to detect the symptoms of a disease very early. With various innovative tools and technologies, doctors can remotely monitor the patient's condition. 

*Any industry that generates large amounts of data needs data science.* 

The medical industry produces large datasets of helpful information about patient demographics, treatment plans, health check results, insurance, and more. The data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices has attracted the attention of data scientists.

All these techniques and methods make it essential to have data science in the <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/how-to-build-a-rewarding-career-as-a-healthcare-data-scientist" target="_blank">healthcare</a>industry.

### Can data scientists work in healthcare?    
  
So far, we have established that data scientists play a significant role in the healthcare industry, so the answer to this question is *'Absolutely!'*. 

**As a medical data scientist, these will be your responsibilities.**

The role of the data scientist is to implement all the technologies of data science and incorporate them into health software. Data scientists extract valuable insights from the data to create predictive models. Overall, the tasks of data scientists in health care are:

- Data collection from patients.
- Analysis of hospital needs to perform data analysis using a variety of tools.
- Implement algorithms in your data to gain insights.
- The development team creates a predictive model.

## Applications of Data Science in Healthcare

The uses of data science in healthcare are close to infinity. But let us see some of the most critical applications. 

### Medical Image Analysis:-

Data science identifies scanned images to find defects in the human body and helps doctors develop effective treatment strategies. These medical imaging tests include x-rays, ultrasonography, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and CT scans. Proper analysis of images from these tests helps doctors gain valuable knowledge to treat them better.

**Algorithms used in medical image analysis**

- **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** This helps identify conditions such as fractures and dislocations.

- **Image Processing Algorithms:** Image processing algorithms are useful for image analysis, improvement, and noise reduction.

- **Descriptive Image Recognition Algorithm:** Visualises and extracts data from images. The data is then used to interpret and form larger images (for example, merge images from brain scans and name them accordingly.)

### Predictive Analytics in Healthcare      

A predictive analytics model based on data science makes predictions about a patient's condition. It also helps develop strategies for the appropriate treatment for the patient. Therefore, predictive analytics is a beneficial technique and plays a vital role in the medical industry.

**Algorithms used in predictive analysis**

- **Classification Model:** For categorizing patient data according to requirements and needs.

- **Clustering Model:** The clustering model sorts the data into separate nested intelligent groups based on similar attributes. Clustering is a valuable technique in the medical sector for detecting patterns and organization in labeled and unlabeled information.

- **Forecast Model:** As one of the most widely used predictive analytics models, forecasting models involve predicting metric values ​​and estimating new data numbers based on insights from historical data.


### Genomics   

In the past, genomics research was a tedious and time-consuming task before the advent of robust data analysis techniques. This is because millions of pairs of DNA cells exist in the human body. But now, data science applications in healthcare and genomics make that task easier. With the help of various data science and big data tools, we can analyze human genes with less effort and time. In addition, with these tools, researchers can easily find the drug that best responds to a particular genetic problem or a particular type of gene.

**Algorithms used in Genomics**

- **V Framework:** The V framework categorizes volume, velocity, and variety of data. Genomics is used to analyze the current data concerning other applications in data sciences. 

- **4M Framework:** Data science mining in the natural sciences is closely related to mathematical modeling. A concise way to understand this relationship is the 4M frameworks developed by Lauffenburger. This concept describes the overall process of systems biology, closely related to genomics in quantity measurement large-scale mining. Model the extracted observations and manipulate or test this model to ensure accuracy.

So these are some of the applications of data science in the clinical industry. There are many more, but these are some of the prime examples. Let's see what you will do as a specialist in this domain.


## Role of a Data Scientist in the Healthcare domain    

- Most data scientists have technical skills such as probability and statistics, data visualization, machine learning, AI knowledge, and programming languages ​​such as R, Python, and SQL. While these skills can help you analyze through sources, healthcare data scientists must, first and foremost, be strong problem-solvers who understand their organization's goals.

- Another common requirement for Healthcare Data Science jobs is a good understanding of quantitative data analysis. Due to the large amount of data generated by hospitals and authorities, data scientists must organize, manage, and analyze different datasets without being overwhelmed. When a large amount of information is mixed, healthcare data scientists are expected to connect points and identify solutions and suggestions to help businesses achieve their goals.


### Other common roles played by healthcare data scientists are:-   

- Convert data into digestible nibbles that non-technical members of the organization can understand.  
- Understand hospital functions and systems and use data results to support decision-making. 
- Database management includes data collection, storage, acquisition, security, etc. 
- To create reports and dashboards to give administrators access to results.
- Be agile enough to jump over different dashboards to types of records, from operational to clinical to financial.
