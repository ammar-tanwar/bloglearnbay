**Enhanced use of data analysis in every industry**

Today's marketing strategy relies on digital data and its predictive analysis report to better introspect a business because of customers. Hence, these data whether structured or unstructured are directly related to business revenues.

The biggest trend of data analysis we see in the banking sector and e-Commerce sector. No doubt this is ever growing data. Hence, data analysis will be a continuous need in the market, depicting a secured job platform for future data scientists.

**The gap between demand and supply**

Data science is a vast field which includes different big data technologies as well. As per the statistics, almost 50,000 vacancies are available in the Indian market whereas there is a scarcity of skilled professionals in the same field. Hence, there is a big scope to getting a job with less competition if you have required skill.

**Experience is not a big concern**

Data science is a growing field hence only seven years of experience sometimes makes a big difference. If you have minimum five years of experience or less than that you have a higher chance to get a job in this field. Also, many companies train even freshers with necessary skills to fulfill the demand as there is a lack of resources in the market.

**Lucrative salary package**

40% advertised data science jobs offer more than 10 Lakh salaries per annum for data science professionals in India. However, the average salaries in data science jobs in India are 7 Lakh per annum with a minimum starting salary around 5 -6 Lakh/annum.

**Scope to learn various skill sets**

The job role in data science field may be anything from

- Data Engineer
- Data analyst
- Data Architect
- Data scientist

As data science has many aspects from data sourcing to data visualization, the skill set requirement may be role based. Hence, there is a huge scope to learn many tools and theories to perform the roles. Some of the most demanded skills in the current industry are Python, R, SAS and Tableau professionals

**More use of semi-structured and unstructured data**

To achieve meaningful insights from big data, mostly unstructured and semi-structured data are used for analysis nowadays. Data science methodologies and tools are enormously helpful for this purpose. Hence, the demand will surge continually in this field.

**No specific educational background to excel in this field**

Of course, if you are a number cruncher, you will edge over others. However, data science is not all about statistics, and as mentioned earlier based on the role you can explore many areas. Though 80% of [data science jobs](http://www.learnbay.in/blog-post/why-you-should-choose-data-science-as-your-career/) are acquired by engineers and management graduates, others also hold a good percentage with the help of proper training.
