<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Learn the Difference Between Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning </span>

If you want to understand how to utilize massive amounts of data presented to you effectively, then Machine Learning will surely benefit you.

Machine Learning (ML) models use algorithms and learn from datasets to understand and replicate human behavior. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, it requires intelligent algorithms to be able to function efficiently.

There are different Machine Learning models (Supervised, Unsupervised, And Reinforcement Learning) that are suitable for different kinds of datasets. For example, Supervised, Unsupervised, And Reinforcement Learning algorithm is widely used in industries to predict business outcome and forecast result based on historical data.

Let's understand it with an example.

You have a bucket of fruits, and there are different types of fruits in the bucket. So you need to separate the fruits according to their features, and you know the name of the fruits follow up their corresponding features. The features of the fruits are independent variables, and the name of the fruits are dependent variables; that is, the target variable. So you can build a predicting model to determine the fruit name.

## Supervised Learning:-

The output of any supervised learning depends on the target variables. It allows the numerical, categorical, discrete, and linear datasets to build a Machine Learning model. The target variable is known for building the model. That model predicts the outcome based on the target variable if any new data point comes to the dataset.

The supervised learning model teaches the machine to predict the result for the unseen input. It contains a known dataset to train the machine and its performance during the training time of a model. And then, the model predicts the testing data's response when fed to the trained model. The supervised algorithm uses regression and classification techniques for building predictive models.

### There are various types of Supervised learning.   

### Linear regression and Logistic regression

Linear and logistic regression is used when we have continuous data. Linear regression defines the relationship between the variables where we have independent and dependent variables. For example, what would be the performance percentage of a student after studying for several hours? The numbers of hours is an independent feature, and the student's performance is the dependent feature.

Linear regression is also categorized into types. Those are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.

### Decision tree - Random forest and k-Nearest neighbors   

Classification algorithms help to classify categorical values. It is used for categorical, discrete, or values belonging to a particular class. Decision tree Random forest and KNN are all used for the categorical dataset.

Popular or major classification applications include bank credit scoring, medical imaging, and speech recognition. Also, handwriting recognition uses classification to recognize letters and numbers, check whether an email is genuine or spam, detect whether a tumor is benign or cancerous, and recommender systems.

### Support vector machine   

The support vector machine is used for both classification and regression problems. It uses the regression method to create a hyperplane to classify the category of the data point. Sentiment analysis of a subject is determined with the help of SVM whether the statement is positive or negative.

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms  

Unsupervised learning is a technique in which we need to supervise the model as we do not have any target variable or labeled dataset. It discovers its information to predict the outcome. It is used for unlabeled datasets. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks than supervised learning.

Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning methods. It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual intervention.

For example, We have a bucket of fruits and need to separate them accordingly. No target variable is available to determine whether the fruit is an apple, orange, or banana. Unsupervised learning categorizes these fruits to make a prediction when new data comes.

### Types of unsupervised learning   

- **Hierarchical clustering**

Hierarchical clustering is an algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It begins with all the data assigned to a cluster of their own. Here, two close clusters are going to be in the same cluster. This algorithm ends when there is only one cluster left.

- **K-means clustering & K-NN (k nearest neighbors)**

K-means and KNN are also clustering methods to classify the dataset. K-means is an iterative method of clustering and is also used to find the highest value for every iteration; we can select the number of clusters. It would help if you defined the k cluster for making an excellent predictive model.

K- nearest neighbor is the simplest of all Machine Learning classifiers. It differs from other Machine Learning techniques because it doesn't produce a model. Instead, it is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure.

- **Principal Component Analysis**

<a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis" target="_blank"> PCA (Principal component analysis)</a> is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. For example, you have a dataset with 200 features/columns. You need to reduce the number of features for the model to only an important feature. It maintains the complexity of the dataset.

- **Singular Value Decomposition**

A matrix's Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in linear algebra is factoring that matrix across three matrices. It possesses several intriguing algebraic characteristics and provides essential geometrical and theoretical insights into linear transformations. It has several critical uses in data science as well.

- **Independent Component Analysis**

In various uses involving medical signals, biological testing, & audio signals, ICA has been utilized to recover source signals. When ICA may eliminate or keep a single source, it is referred to as a dimensionality reduction algorithm.

## Reinforcement Learning  

Reinforcement learning is also a type of Machine Learning algorithm. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning programming strategy that rewards positive actions while penalizing undesirable ones. A reinforcement learning agent, in general, can detect and comprehend its surroundings, act, and learn via trial and error.

It provides a suitable action in a particular situation and is used to maximize the reward. The reward could be positive or negative based on the object's behavior. Reinforcement learning is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior in a situation.

### Main points in Reinforcement learning      

- **Input:** The input should be an initial state from which the model will start
- **Output:** There are many possible outputs, as there are a variety of solutions to a particular problem
- **Training:** The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state, and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.
- The model keeps learning.
- The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.

### How does it work?        

Developers establish a way of rewarding desired actions and punishing bad ones in reinforcement learning. This strategy provides positive values to desired acts and negative ones to undesirable behaviors to motivate the agent. The agent is programmed to find the long-term and greatest overall return to obtain an ideal answer.

These long-term objectives keep the agent from stagnating on shorter-term objectives. The agent gradually learns to shun the negative and pursue the positive. This learning strategy has been implemented in AI technology to control unsupervised machine learning via incentives and punishments.

## In Conclusion:-    

Supervised learning is when a model is guided in learning from a labelled dataset. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is when the computer receives instruction based on unlabeled data with no direction. While reinforcement learning occurs when a system or perhaps an agent engages with its environment, takes actions, and learns via a trial-and-error process.
