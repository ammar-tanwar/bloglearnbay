<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> How Data Science has impacted these sectors to grow exponentially</span>

"*Consumer data will be the biggest differentiator in the next two to three years. Whoever unlocks the reams of data and uses it strategically will win."* â€“ Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice President of Retail at Apple Inc.

The same is true for every industry. The role of data science in Media Hospitality and Transportation has taken their field by storm. 

Media, Hospitality, and Transportation have been one of the most profitable industries as of now. Even a few countries' GDPs become 70% dependent on travel, tourism, and media businesses. Consequently, the pay scales of promising candidates in these sectors also touch the sky. 

But a pandemic hit in the last couple of years has impacted these industries immensely. The Pandemic has resulted in increased unemployment rates in these industries. The New York Times revealed that about 37,000 media employees (highly paid) lost their jobs. About 30 million American Citizens from these industries have become jobless. If this is the image of the US, then you can easily imagine the picture of India and other Asian countries. 

One thing that has risen in these trying times and given a boost to these sectors is Data Science. Let us see how data science in Media, Hospitality, and Transportation has helped businesses boom.

## How Data Science has helped Media hospitality and Transportation Industries:-

The most worrying thing in the Pandemic hit for professionals is that the higher your salary, the greater your chances of losing the job.

So, can media, hospitality, and transportation pros secure their lucrative career?

*Indeed, there is a way.*

This article talks about the challenges faced by the Media, Hospitality, and Transportation sectors. Based on a relevant case study in these sectors, revolutionizing technologies, such as <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/why-you-need-data-science/" target="_blank">Data Science</a> and Artificial Intelligence, have benefitted these industries in overcoming their obstacles to increasing corporate efficiency.

### Media     

The media industry has been known to be one of the most lucrative industries. Due to the Pandemic surge, many movie productions were stopped therefore incurring a lot of loss for the whole crew. The struggling actors especially had a hard time, as discussed in this <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/bigstory-with-pandemic-hitting-the-film-industry-hard-how-are-struggling-actors-and-debutantes-coping-up-with-the-sudden-break-in-their-yet-to-be-launched-careers/articleshow/82221597.cms" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Times of India</a> issue. The competitive algorithm of social media platforms has hit the media industry quite hard.

### Hospitality  

The hospitality industry was affected gravely by the Pandemic's rise and the imposition of a global lockdown. Many small family restaurant chains had to shut down. Even hotels were affected when most people were being separated from their families due to COVID, and the hotels had to spend a large amount of revenue to equip these people whilst maintaining the integrity and safety of the hotel staff. This had a lot of people quitting their jobs and being unemployed for a very long time.

### Transportation   


The Transportation Industry is not indifferent to losses. The pressure on the organization during this coronavirus pandemic is from the relocation of citizens to the core transport with the essential workforce to keep cargo and important workers on the move. The side effect of this shift is the sudden change in the revenue sources of transportation companies, many of which are experiencing unexpected financial constraints. Organizations must plan to ensure that the transport network is ready to return to normal. An article by <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-impact-on-transportation-sector.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deloitte</a> has outlined all the shortcomings of the transport industry.

**So what can be done?** 

These industries need to make space for more <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/know-the-best-strategy-to-find-the-right-data-science-job-in-delhi/" target="_blank">data science jobs</a> to revive their infrastructure. Data science tools will allow a much better understanding of the pain points in the domains and help with their growth even during a natural disaster. 

If this needs to be more convincing, consider the need for data science in the sectors mentioned above.

## Need for Data Science in Media Hospitalit and Transportation   
### Media  

Every day, digital reality presents new challenges to big players in the entertainment and media markets. Customers are more likely to seek the best service, no matter the circumstance. This market is becoming more competitive by the day. The application of data science to various aspects of daily life is a new trend that requires entertainment and media professionals to think creatively.

**Personalized Marketing:** A company's ability to attract customers' attention is crucial, especially if it is involved in the entertainment and media business. It is easier to market to the right customers and keep their attention through a quick and memorable online experience. This is achieved effectively through data science.

**Real-time analytics:** Real-time name analytics refers to the ability to process data quickly and present the results in a short time. The speed at which media and entertainment companies process the data is crucial.

**Content distribution on social media:** Social media has given media and entertainment companies an excellent opportunity to strengthen their marketing strategies through the powerful tool of social content distribution. 

Using data science, large media companies can now view general tendencies, user preferences, experiences, interests, and histories in one click.

**Analysis of media content usage:** Big media companies can use data science algorithms to make data work for them and generate profit. Media content analysis is a well-developed method that analyses the message and connotations of content. 

The media content analysis process consists of two primary levels: capture and understanding. The algorithms identify patterns and incidents within the text. We can then process the data. These frameworks are used to define the tone of the text. Its influence on the user can be predicted.

### Hospitality    

AI and DS technologies are used in many industries, but the most exciting application is hospitality. Recently, however, the hospitality industry has been seeing many changes. The industry is embracing these advanced technologies with open minds.

**Marketing:** Machine Learning systems enable hotels to analyze historical data to make better decisions. Marketers can use all these inputs to target the right audience at the right moment with targeted campaigns.

**Revenue management:** When data drives revenue management, hotels can forecast demand and analyze customer behaviour patterns more accurately. It automatically integrates and analyses stacks of data from multiple sources, saving a lot of labour.

**Booking engine:** AI-powered booking engines collect data each time a potential guest interacts with the website. These engines often have advanced learning algorithms to analyze the data to learn more about customers and provide the best price.

**Reputation management:** Reputation management systems help you build trust and brand loyalty. These systems can be AI-based, which increases their capabilities. Sentiment Analysis can be used as a great example. Natural language processing (NLP) dedicates the intent or sentiment behind an opinion or review. It is a highly effective method of gauging people's thoughts about your brand.

### Transportation  

The premise of data science combines data sources with external data sets (e.g., search, social media reviews, weather, traffic reports, weather, and weather) to solve problems, reduce costs, and predict future events.

**Enhanced Customer Service:** Personalization has an advantage. This is allowing the transportation industry to improve customer service. Delta Airlines provides a Guest Services Tool for their SkyPro devices to their flight attendants. This tool and device can be used by flight attendants to improve customer service by reviewing preferences. 

United Airlines attendants also have access to a tool that gives them information about customers, such as last flight details, dietary requirements, and their connection schedule.

**Identifying MVCs (Most Valuable Customers):** Some customers will travel more than others; it is a fact. Companies need to be aware of significant players to avoid customer churn. Already, the travel industry has a considerable legacy of data about MVCs from loyalty programs. 

Combining historical data with predictive and real-time analytics is the key to anticipating what MVCs want in the future. It is much more expensive to acquire a customer than keep an existing one.

**Up-Selling and Cross-Selling:** Suppose you are travelling to Buenos Aires to attend a four-day business conference, and then you will spend a weekend exploring the city. You want a flight that departs Sunday and arrives early Monday. Your airline will offer cross-selling and upselling opportunities using DS technologies.

**Safer Travel:** DS can save lives when it comes to safety. Transportation data scientists develop complex algorithms to predict and even prevent problems. Many sensors are available in today's automobiles, trains, and planes. 

These sensors provide control centres with continuous streaming data that provides real-time information on all aspects of the journey (e.g., driver behaviour, environment, performance, etc.).

## What are data science tools used in the media hospitality and transportation industries?  
There are various DS tools used in all these industries. These are some of the tools and their uses.

### 1. SAS
