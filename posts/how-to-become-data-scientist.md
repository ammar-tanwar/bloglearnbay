**HOW TO BECOME DATA SCIENTIST?**

"_A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician_."

Data scientists are **big data solver experts**. Their role is to take an enormous mass of messy data points and apply their formidable skills in maths, statistics, and programming to organize data in a planned way. After that, they apply all their analytic powers, learned industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions to understand hidden solutions to all the business challenges. Through this blog, we will discuss all the related data science training programs, online data training programs in Bangalore and machine learning training in Bangalore to become the data scientists.

**Data Scientist Responsibilities**

• They usually conduct undirected research and **solve unorganized patterns.**

• To collect huge amounts of data from various internal and external sources.

• To apply sophisticated programs, machine learning and statistical methods to prepare data which can be used to predict the upcoming challenges.

• Thoroughly extract the relevant data and refine it to give a better understanding of the concept.

• Examine data from a wide range of angles to undermine hidden weaknesses, trends and/or opportunities.

• Devise **data-driven solutions** to the mysterious problems.

• They are experts in inventing new algorithms to solve problems and build new tools to automate work on a smooth pattern.

How to become Data Scientists?

Frankly speaking, you have 3 education options if someone is looking to make a career in data science and they are:

• **Degrees and Graduate Certificates** will simply provide you the structure, internships, networking and recognized academic qualifications for your resume. But the biggest disadvantage is that you it can cost you expensive and **time-consuming**.

• Online and classroom [data science training](http://www.learnbay.in/shop/courses/data-science-r-training-bangalore-learnbay/) is short and targeted. They allow you to complete projects on your own time and makes you structure your own academic path. Example – Learnbay data science training course will make you an expert in data science courses.

• **Boot camps are intense and faster** to complete than traditional degrees. But the biggest disadvantage of them is that won't give you degree initials after your name.
