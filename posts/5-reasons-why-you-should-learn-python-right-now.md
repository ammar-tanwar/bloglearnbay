_"Python is the future of Artificial intelligence"._With modules like numpy,scipy,Pandas Python dominates the data science and machine learning space and became one of the preferred language for computer science research.

4. **Web development And Automation**

With modules like django and Flask,Web applications can be developed in python very quickly.web development features that takes _hours_ in PHP could be done in _minutes_ using Python in less time and with more reliable and better code.Python is used in almost every kind of automation and is replacing TCL,Perl,Shell scripting.
