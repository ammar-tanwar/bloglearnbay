Google has officially announced that it has unified its AutoML and AI Platform **APIs** into one managed platform called **Vertex AI**. Vertex AI Workbench is a single platform where data scientists can execute all of their machine learning processes, from testing to deployment to model administration and monitoring. It combines AutoML and AI Platform into a unified API, client library, and user experience. **It's a fully managed, scalable, and enterprise-ready Jupyter-based compute infrastructure with security controls and user management features.** 

It's crucial to comprehend the significance of machine learning before understanding more about Vertex AI. Many people may be wondering how <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/future-of-education-in-hands-of-machine-learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and AI are related, and the answer is simple. **Machine learning** is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows a machine to learn from previous data without having to explicitly build it. The goal of AI is to develop a smart computer system capable of solving complex problems in the same manner that humans can. **Machine learning's** purpose is to enable machines to learn from data and produce accurate results.

## **How did Vertex AI become acquainted with the firm?**

**Google's cloud-based machine learning platform, Cloud ML, is a game-changer in the perspective of how enterprises may use AI to improve their products and services. With Cloud ML, enterprises can quickly train, update, and deploy machine learning models.** It also provides users with a range of strong tools that allow them to confidently manage their data and models. Google's groundbreaking research forms the foundation for **Cloud ML.**

**Cloud ML** is a Google AI ecosystem extension that allows you to simply incorporate models into your existing cloud-based architecture. This allows for mainstream businesses to receive the benefits.

## Benefits of Vertex [AI](https://www.youtube.com/c/Learnbay/search?query=AI) **Workbench:-**


- ### **Exploration and analysis are simple-**     

BigQuery, Dataproc, Spark, and Vertex AI integration simplify data access and machine learning access in the notebook.

- ### **Model development and rapid prototyping-**

To go from data to training at scale, take advantage of the potential of unbounded compute with Vertex AI training for exploration and prototyping.

- ### **Notebook workflows from start to finish-**   

Vertex AI Workbench allows you to centralize your training and deployment procedures on Vertex AI.

## **How to get started with Vertex and create a dataset**  

To train a machine learning model, you'll need a sample set of data to start with. Create an empty dataset using the console (or API) and then import your data into it. After importing the data, you can make changes and begin training the model.

## **To be specific you need to attain 4 steps in order to go further with the dataset in ML:-** 

### **1. Prepare image data.**   

This page explains how to get image data ready to use in a Vertex AI dataset. The format of image input data is determined by the goal. Currently, the following image goals are supported:

- **Classification of images (single-label)**
- **Classification of images (multi-label)**
- **Detecting objects in images**

### **2. Construct a table using the training data.**

This page explains how to get your tabular data ready to use in a Vertex AI dataset. AutoML or custom-trained models can be trained using Vertex AI datasets. The effectiveness of the models you construct is influenced by the quality of your training data.

### **3. Prepare textual data for training.**    

This page explains how to get text data ready to be used in a Vertex AI dataset. The aim determines the format of text input data. Text categorization, for example, necessitates data preparation that differs from text sentiment analysis.

### **4. Extract video data.**

This page explains how to prepare video footage for use in a Vertex AI dataset. The purpose determines the format of video input data. Currently, the following video objectives are supported:

- **Classification**
- **Action Recognition**
- **Tracking of objects**

## **Vertex AI Use Cases**

### **Vertex AI can help data scientists and machine learning developers in a variety of ways.**

- Use Vertex AI Data Labeling to boost prediction accuracy and analyze high-quality training data by importing data from Cloud Storage and Big Query.

- To serve, reuse, and distribute ML features, use Vertex AI Feature Store (a fully-managed feature-rich repository)

- Streamline the development and execution of machine learning processes with Vertex AI Pipelines.

- Vertex AI Prediction simplifies the deployment and monitoring of models in the field.

- Get detailed model feature attributions and evaluation metrics with Vertex Explainable AI.
