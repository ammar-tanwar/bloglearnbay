<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Learn About the Extensive Use of Data Science in the Petroleum Sector</span>

The oil and gas sectors have been the most lucrative arena for most chemical engineers, petroleum engineers, mechanical engineers, and even geologists (petroleum). Not only the private occupations but also the government job scopes are high in this subject. But beyond all expectations, people in these industries are at significant risk of losing their employment. So what occurred all of a sudden?

Well, no need to get panic. We all know that other ways open up if one road gets blocked. Data Science and AI are the ultimate escape route from this roadblock. This blog discusses data science in the energy, oil, and gas industries. But first, let's look into 'what's happening?"

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/reward1.png" alt="A graphical representation of the unemployment rate between 2014 to 2020 in oil and gas industry"/>

## What's happening in the Petroleum industry?

According to PetroLMI, which provides industry labour market information, the unemployment rate peaked at 16.1% in 2020, 26% below 2014 levels, especially for oil and gas workers. People working in this industry quit alone due to the lack of growth. Those who have more experience are also outside the green zone. 

What is essential to keep your ground in this domain is your skills. Therefore, you need to keep upskilling. Only then will you be safe.  

### How to upskill yourself?      

The oil and gas industry lives and breathes on data. The industry's been going digital as well recently. So you will not only retain your position in the industry but also have good pay as a <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/different-jobs-opportunities-of-data-science" target="_blank">Data science specialist</a>.

Data Science salary is a hot topic everyone thinks about when becoming a data scientist. We all have heard praises about how lucrative the Data Science field is. So much, so that data scientists are notorious for being pompous. They aren't to be blamed, though. A data scientist makes big bucks in any and every domain. It is a very versatile field, and the domain-specific approach of specific organizations makes it a game-changer for many people looking to make that career switch.

Now that we have established that Data Science is a very profitable field and there is a need for it in every sector let's shift your attention to the topic at hand, the importance of data science in the energy, oil, and gas industry. So let us start by asking some critical questions.

## Use of Data Science in the Energy Oil and Gas Industry   

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/reward2.png" alt="An illustration of an oil and gas tanker with the caption DATA SCIENCE IN oil, Gas, and Energy Domain."/>


The oil and gas business needs to include data science, a reassessment of data's intrinsic worth and strategic assets. In addition, like other industries, today's oil and gas industry is looking for ways to improve efficiency, reduce operating costs and increase revenue.

However, oil and gas companies are also subject to exceptional safety, environmental, and regulatory reporting requirements in contrast to many industries. Therefore, data science has many advantages that can help improve data efficiency and increase sales when adopted in the industry. With this, you can make out that Data Science is essential in the domain we are talking about.

### Need for Data Science in the Energy Oil and Gas Domain

- The amount of data in the oil and gas industry increases exponentially due to advances in information technology.
- This includes everything from sensor recording during exploration, drilling, production, and seismic manipulation to in-drill logging (LWD) technology that enables real-time recording of drilling data.
- It also includes fibre optic solutions that provide a wide range of data on environmental conditions such as temperature, oil reserves, equipment performance, and condition. Managing this data and using it as a strategic asset can significantly impact its financial performance.
- The plunge in oil prices has forced oil and gas companies to go beyond traditional methods to seek broader changes in business practices to improve performance and reduce costs.
- Better data analysis and technology are essential in determining the success of oil and gas companies.
  
## Advantages of Data Science in the Energy Oil and Gas Industry.

As of now, we have established that data science has found its uses in various fields. That is because Data Science has multiple advantages no matter where you want to use it. Such is the malleability of this field. It has numerous advantages in any field that it is applied to.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/reward3.png" alt="A photo of an energy, oil, and gas factory site."/>

### Here are some high-level examples of how data science can help the oil and gas industry.     

**Exploration and Discovery-** Geological data such as seismic data and rock types in nearby drilling holes can predict oil pockets.

**Production Accounting-** You can link production data to alarms.

**Drilling and Completion-** Predictive Analytics can use geological completion and drilling data to determine preferred and optimal drilling sites.

**Equipment Maintenance-** Compare real-time streaming data from oil rigs with past drills to better predict and avoid problems and understand operational risk. These examples show the operational goals of oil and gas data science.


### As with other technological advances there are some disadvantages to the successful use of data science:-    

**Taxing Compute Resources-** You may need more resources to store and process large amounts of structured and unstructured data.

**Poor data quality-** Data is stored in multiple locations and can be subject to inconsistent governance.

**Incorrect Modelling-** The correct question may not have been asked or misunderstood.

**Relentless Corporate-** C-suite support is essential from the start. In addition, communication between employees, SMBs, and data scientists is essential.

**Talent Gap-** Data science and data engineering talent is new to the oil and gas industry. These skills still need to be developed, and putting together the right team can take time and effort.

## Projects To Level Up Your Resume   


When we talk about entering a specific specialization job market, it is essential to have the proper skills displayed on your resume to make you fit for the role. The best way to achieve that is through projects. These are some of the Oil and Gas domain-based projects you can do to become a Data Science specialist in the field.

- Prediction of cost overruns in Oil and Gas Engineering
- Developing a Failure Prediction Model
- Model for determining the optimum and efficient use of machines.
  
## What are companies hiring for Energy oil and gas data scientists?
