<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> What is XGBoost, the Machine Learning Algorithm that's taking over the world?</span>

Gradient boosting (GBM) trees perform unsupervised learning by using data to learn without a predefined model. XGBoost Machine Learning is a well-known gradient-boosting toolkit used for GPU programming, distributed systems, and parallel processing. It is exact, adapts well to many data and issues, has great documentation, and is quite simple.

We'll talk in detail about the XGBoost Classifier here.

## What is the XGboost Classifier?

XGBoost classifier is a boosting Machine Learning algorithm applied for structured and tabular data. It implements gradient-boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. It is an extreme gradient boost algorithm, meaning it's a big Machine Learning algorithm with many parts.

XGBoost works with large, complicated datasets and is an ensemble modeling technique.

## What is Ensemble Modeling?  

XGBoost Machine Learning classifier is an ensemble learning method. Sometimes, it may require more than relying upon the results of just one Machine Learning model. Ensemble learning offers a systematic solution to combine the predictive power of multiple learners. The resultant is a single model that aggregates output from several models.

The models that form the ensemble, also known as base learners, could be either from the same or different learning algorithms. Bagging and boosting are two widely used ensemble learners. Though several statistical models can use these two techniques, decision trees have the most predominant usage.

## Ensemble Algorithms

In machine learning & predictive modeling, ensemble learning mixes numerous learners (models) to increase overall performance and improve predictiveness and accuracy. Ensemble models are powerful because they can integrate thousands of tiny learners skilled in underlying data subsets.

Some intriguing conclusions to be made from these

- Bagging greatly reduces the basic model's variance.
- Boosting reduces the bias as well.
- Stacking also enhances overall predictive power.

### Ensemble Modeling Types


Considering how the sub-learners are created, we can classify ensemble methods into two groups:

1. When learners are developed sequentially: It relies on the interdependence of basic learners. Each learner impacts the next and may determine a regular behavior pattern. AdaBoost is a well-known example of such a sequential ensemble method.

2. When learners are developed parallelly: The base learners are constructed individually to investigate and utilize the impacts of their independence and decrease the error by combining the findings. Random Forest is one example of this method in action.

## Unique features of the XGBoost Classifier          

XGBoost is a popular implementation of gradient boosting. Let's discuss some features of XGBoost Machine Learning that make it so interesting.

### Regularization  

XGBoost Machine Learning classifier can penalize complex models through both L1 and L2 regularization. Regularization helps in preventing overfitting.

### Solving sparse data

Data becomes sparse as a result of incomplete data or information processing operations such as one-hot encoding. XGBoost incorporates a sparsity-aware split-finding algorithm to handle different types of sparsity patterns in the data.

### Weighted quantile sketch

Most existing tree-based algorithms can find the split points when the data points are of equal weight (using a quantile sketch algorithm). XGBoost has a distributed weighted quantile sketch algorithm to handle weighted data effectively.

### Block structure for parallel learning  

The XGBoost Machine Learning classifier can use multiple cores on the CPU for faster computing. This is possible because of a block structure in its system design. Data is sorted and stored in in-memory units called blocks. Unlike other algorithms, this enables the data layout to be reused by subsequent iterations instead of computing it again. This feature is useful for steps like split finding and column sub-sampling.

### Cache awareness

The XGBoost classifier requires non-continuous memory access to get the gradient statistics by row index. Hence, XGBoost Classifier has been designed to make optimal use of hardware. This is done by allocating internal buffers in each thread, where one can store the gradient statistics.

### Out-of-core computing   

This feature optimizes the available disk space and maximizes its usage when handling huge datasets that do not fit into memory.

### Solving the XGBoost mathematically:-

Here we will use simple Training Data, which has a Drug dosage on the x-axis and Drug effectiveness on the y-axis. The above two observations(6.5, 7.5) have a large value for Drug Effectiveness, which means that the drug was helpful, and the below two observations(-10.5, -7.5) have a relatively low value for Drug Effectiveness, which means that the drug was harmful.

The very 1st step in fitting XGBoost Machine Learning Classifier to the training data is to make an initial prediction. It is 0.5 if the XGBoost classifier is used for Regression or Classification.

The broad black horizontal line corresponds to the forecast 0.5.

Unlike unextreme Gradient Boost, which typically uses regular off-the-shelf, Regression Trees, XGBoost Machine Learning uses a unique Regression tree called an XGBoost Tree.

Computing the Residuals' Quality or Similarity scores.

Here λ is a regularization parameter.

So we split the observations into two groups based on whether or not the Dosage\<15.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/xg3.png"   class="img" alt="An flow chart list the following data. 
The chart starts from 'Dosage less than 15'. This splits into  two branches: 'negative 10.5' and 'Dosage less than 30'. The later splites into two sub branches- '6.5, 7.5' and 'negative 8.'"/>

The observation on the left is the only one with a Dosage\<15. All of the other residuals go to the leaf on the right.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/xg4.png"   class="img" alt="A flow chart with similarity of 4 residuals with various observation score.
The chart starts from 'negetive 10.5, 6.5. 7.5, negative 7.5.' This splits into two sub branches: 'negative 10.5' with similarity score 110.25 and '6.5, 7.5, and negatie 7.5' with similarity score 14.08."/>

When we calculate the similarity score for the observations –10.5,-7.5,6.5,7.5 while putting λ =0

we got similarity =4 and

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/xg5.png"   class="img" alt="An equation reads, similarity score equals to open parenthesis negative 10.5 plus 6.5 plus 7.5 plus negative 7.5 close parenthesis to power of 2 divided vy 4 plus 0 (in red)."/>

The result is:

The chart starts from 'Dosage less than 15'. This splits into  two branches: 'negative 10.5' and 'Dosage less than 30'. The later splites into two sub branches- '6.5, 7.5' and 'negative 8.'"/>

## Finally 

The machine learning field presents various new and improved technological applications, including XGBoost. It remains a viable framework concerning prediction accuracy, adaptability, explainability, and practicality. Due to the parallel and distributed processing it possesses, XGBoost is a quicker method in comparison to other methods. XGBoost was created with careful regard for both system efficiency and boosting machine learning techniques. You can visit our site or enroll in an ML course to learn more about this technology.
